## For maintainers

If you want to help maintaining this library, I would suggest to add this **git hooks** on `pre-commit`

In a terminal opened in the repo folder, executes these commands

```bash
echo '#!/bin/sh' > .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo '' >> .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo 'swiftlint' >> .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
